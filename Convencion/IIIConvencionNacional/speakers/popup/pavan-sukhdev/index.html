GIST Advisory</p>
</div></div></div><div class="copy"><p>Pavan Sukhdev is Founder-CEO of <em>GIST Advisory</em>, a consulting collaborative that evaluates performance &ndash; including externalities - for governments &amp; businesses. Pavan was awarded Yale University&rsquo;s McCluskey Fellowship in 2011, and wrote his book <em>&ldquo;Corporation 2020&rdquo;</em> while teaching at Yale in 2011-12. Based on his book, his campaign <em>&ldquo;Corporation 2020&rdquo;</em> (launched at Rio+20) envisions the corporation of the future- one with <em>positive </em>rather than negative externalities- and presents action plans for four rapid reforms to transform today&rsquo;s business for tomorrow&rsquo;s world.</p>

<p>From 2008-2011, Pavan worked as Study Leader for the G8+5 commissioned project &ldquo;TEEB&rdquo; (The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity), a global study of the economic benefits of ecosystems and the social and economic consequences of their loss and degradation. Concurrently, he also led UNEP&rsquo;s &lsquo;Green Economy Initiative&rsquo; and was lead author of the UNEP report <em>&ldquo;Towards a Green Economy&rdquo; . </em>A career banker, Pavan had delivered TEEB&rsquo;s Interim Report (2008) whilst still working full time as a Managing Director at Deutsche Bank, where his last assignment was to set up a leading front-office offshoring operation for their Global Markets division.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Environmental Finance&rdquo; selected Pavan as their &ldquo;Personality of the Year&rdquo; for 2010. The Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management (IEEM), UK, awarded Pavan their 2011 Medal. In 2012, UNEP appointed Pavan their &ldquo;Goodwill Ambassador&rdquo; for his continuing work on promoting TEEB and Green Economy. Pavan was one of two joint winners of the 2013 &ldquo;Gothenburg Award for Sustainable Development&rdquo;, for his work on bringing policy recognition for valuing nature&rsquo;s services. And recently in 2015, Pavan was awarded KfW Foundation&rsquo;s <em>Bernhard Grzimek Award for Biodiversity.</em></p>
