UN Environment Programme (UNEP)</p>
</div></div></div><div class="copy"><p>Ivo Mulder is the REDD+ Green Economy Advisor for UNEP on behalf of the UN-REDD Programme (an inter-agency initiative managed by UNEP, UNDP and FAO that works with +50 partner countries). He leads the work on the economics of REDD+ and supports the work on private sector engagement.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Prior to that he was a Programme Officer at UNEP Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) where he managed the work on ecosystems, water and biodiversity. During the four years at UNEP FI he built a team and founded the Natural Capital Declaration, which aims to mainstream natural capital integration in the finance sector. He also directed an innovative project on sovereign credit risk (called E-RISC), and initiated the UNEP FI REDD+ and Sustainable Land Use programme.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ivo has over nine years of professional experience working in the UN, with consulting firms and NGOs on building the business case for companies especially financial institutions - to deal with climate, water and ecosystem changes. He has published more than forty articles and reports on how and why climate change, biodiversity, and water issues are financially material for banks, insurers and investors. Ivo holds a MSc in Environmental Sciences from Wageningen University in the Netherlands.</p>
