Convention on Biological Diveristy</p>
</div></div></div><div class="copy"><p class="lead">Dr. Dias has over three decades of experience in biodiversity science and policy and its implementation&nbsp;at national and international levels. He brings a unique combination of scientific training and extensive&nbsp;experience to&nbsp;negotiation.&nbsp;He obtained a BSc in Biological Sciences from the University of Brasilia and went on to obtain his PhD in&nbsp;Zoology from the University of Edinburgh in 1981.</p>

<p>While working as division chief for environmental studies for the Brazilian Institute of Geography and&nbsp;Statistics, and as Associate Professor of Forest Protection and Ecology at the University of Brasilia, he&nbsp;became increasingly involved in the negotiations leading up to the adoption of the Convention on&nbsp;Biological Diversity. He was involved in the meetings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee&nbsp;of the Convention on Biological Diversity in 1991 and 1992, served on the Brazilian Delegation for the&nbsp;United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992, as well as&nbsp;on the Intergovernmental Committee of the CBD in 1993 and 1994.</p>

<p>Mr. Dias has since participated in each of the meetings of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the&nbsp;Convention on Biological Diversity as a member of the Brazilian Delegation, and was one of the co-organizers&nbsp;of the eighth meeting of the Conference of the Parties, held in Curitiba Brazil in 2006.&nbsp;He has also been a member of the Brazilian Delegation in most of the meetings of the Subsidiary Body&nbsp;on Scientific Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA), and was vice president of the SBSTTA bureau&nbsp;representing Latin America 1994-1996.</p>

<p>During the period 1992-2011, he participated extensively in the major inter-sessional meetings and&nbsp;workshops of the CBD, and played a prominent role in the preparation, conception and negotiation of&nbsp;the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which was adopted by&nbsp;Governments in Nagoya Japan in October 2010.</p>

<p>His scientific background and training has been mobilized in the service of a number of international&nbsp;initiatives relating to biodiversity science and policy. He was a member of the Scientific Steering&nbsp;Committee and the Advisory Committee of the DIVERSITAS Program from 1997 to 1999, coordinator of&nbsp;the Steering Committee of the Inter-American Biodiversity Information Network (IABIN/OAS) from&nbsp;1997-2002 and vice-president of the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS) from 2004-2007.&nbsp;Dr. Dias also was a member of the Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP/UNEP) of the Global&nbsp;Environment Facility (GEF) from 2006 to 2007.</p>

<p>Mr. Dias&rsquo; experience at the international level is informed by his work at the national level in Brazil in&nbsp;implementing the Convention on Biological Diversity. Among others, he coordinated the National&nbsp;Biodiversity Programme (PRONABIO) since 1994, coordinated the negotiations for the creation of&nbsp;Brazil&rsquo;s National Biodiversity Policy (1998-2002) and coordinated the National Biological Diversity Project&nbsp;&ndash; PROBIO (1996-2005). His interest in ways to mainstream biodiversity into the activities of other&nbsp;economic sectors was realized in his coordination of the National Biodiversity Mainstreaming Project &ndash;&nbsp;PROBIO II (2009-present) and his work on the relationship of business and biodiversity.</p>

<p>He has occupied leading positions in the Brazilian Federal Government administration. Before joining&nbsp;the Secretariat, he was Secretary of Biodiversity and Forests at the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment&nbsp;since September 2010, and before that was Director for Biodiversity Conservation since 1999,&nbsp;overseeing national biodiversity and forest programs directly implemented by the Ministry of the&nbsp;Environment and the national programs implemented by institutes subordinate to the Ministry.</p>
