Holly has been the Chair of the IUCN SSC&rsquo;s African Elephant Specialist Group for over 20 years. She has led many technical evaluations for the GEF, UNEP, IUCN, WWF and other NGOs and development agencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Between 2009 and the end of 2012, Holly brought to bear these many years of experience to work closely with PPR (Kering) in the establishment of its new sustainability department, PPR HOME.&nbsp; As an integral part of PPR HOME&rsquo;s development, Holly became Director and Special Advisor for Sustainability&nbsp;in Spring 2011.&nbsp; She was responsible for the programme side of PPR HOME, overseeing the team of specialists and advising the brands of PPR on key challenges in their supply chains. Among the key pioneering brand initiatives that PPR HOME supported was the Environmental Profit &amp; Loss (E P &amp; L) account and Holly was a member of the core team in its development and strategic rollout.&nbsp; Last year she oversaw a major feasibility study into the development of a Social Profit &amp; Loss account and now leads the B Team&rsquo;s work to establish their E P&amp;L Consortium in her capacity as Director of Strategies.</p>
