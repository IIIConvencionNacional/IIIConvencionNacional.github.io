He is providing advice and support on a range of sustainability issues including in the development of Nestl&eacute;&rsquo;s approach to water stewardship, deforestation and natural capital. An important aspect of the role is to maintain and enhance relations and collaboration with a variety of environmental and social non-governmental organisations and other outside stakeholders.</p>

<p>Before joining Nestl&eacute;, Duncan&rsquo;s career has seen him move from the corporate sector, to the non-profit sector and back again. With a degree in forestry he worked for a variety of forest companies and spent 9 years with Shell firstly in their London head office, and then in Chile and Uruguay. He spent almost 10 years with WWF International heading their Forest Programme in Europe, then as Director of the Global Forest Programme and finally as the Director responsible for WWF&rsquo;s global thematic work on energy, water, forests, species, oceans and policy. In 2010 he joined Nestl&eacute; as independent Sustainability Advisor, and became a permanent employee in 2013.&nbsp;</p>
