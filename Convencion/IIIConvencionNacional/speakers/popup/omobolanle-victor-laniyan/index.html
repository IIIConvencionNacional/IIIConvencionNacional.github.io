</div></div></div><div class="copy"><p>Omobolanle Victor-Laniyan has been working in the field of Sustainability and Communications for over 17 years. She joined Access Bank in 2008 to establish the Sustainability function and has since led the Bank&rsquo;s efforts in its Sustainability performance. In 2011, she initiated the Nigeria Sustainable Finance Week to create awareness and education on Sustainability and the need for the financial sector in Nigeria to develop a set of principles that will guide their sustainability performance. This was implemented in collaboration with UNEPFI and the DFIs, leading to the development of the Nigeria Sustainable Banking Principles.</p>

<p>Omobolanle has since been actively involved in ensuring implementation both within Access Bank and other financial institutions. She serves as the internal leader and &ldquo;go to&rdquo; expert for sustainability in Access Bank and the financial sector, monitoring emerging trends, programs and issues; communicating and educating others on sustainability. She leads the interface with stakeholders (domestic and international), on the Bank&#39;s sustainability agenda and also responds to questions or statements of position on Sustainability related matters. She mentors Sustainability champions in other African financial institutions and provides them with relevant support required to implement the necessary positive change in their institutions.</p>
