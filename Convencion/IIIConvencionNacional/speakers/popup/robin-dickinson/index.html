<p>After a successful career in enterprise software marketing at SAP AG, Robin moved to planning renewable energy projects and then into the Carbon Trust.&nbsp; Focusing on the development of business scale metrics and labels covering carbon emissions over product life cycles, Robin ran international pilot projects that supported the development of the PAS 2050 standard and then went on to facilitate the international alignment of PCF schemes, tools and standards worldwide. Robin also spoke on behalf of the FCO in Europe and the Far East on the topic of the business benefits associated with early action on Climate Change. After a brief foray into Water Footprinting and Partner Development at PE International AG, Robin was instrumental in the formulation of the BIQ Forum, a partnership between his consultancy, Green Growth International Ltd, WWF UK and ADAS Ltd. The BIQ Forum&rsquo;s purpose is to facilitate the creation of a nexus for the synthesis of open, free, material and affordable business scale biodiversity and ecosystem service metrics that will enable business managers to act, contribute to Natural Capital quantification and allow many of the emerging proprietary approaches to gain momentum by leveraging a common,&nbsp; internationally agreed, platform. Robin is also a founding partner of AQOIA ltd and has developed an Environmental Cost to Serve overlay for their Enterprise Operational Analytics platform that facilitates the conversion of operational financial insight into returns from customer collaboration.</p><div class="clearfix"></div></div> </div>			<!-- /modal-body -->
