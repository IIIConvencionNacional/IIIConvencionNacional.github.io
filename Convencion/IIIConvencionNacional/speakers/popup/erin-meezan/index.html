Interface, Inc</p>
</div></div></div><div class="copy"><p class="lead">In 1994, modular carpetmaker Interface shifted the vision and focus of its manufacturing to becoming a sustainable and ultimately restorative enterprise. This transformational shift changed the companies processes, products, but also its people. A by product of the new thinking that this sustainability focus ushered in was a new way of doing business, a changed culture that took hold in all levels of the company from management teams to factory employees. Interface has acknowledged the importance of this unique culture of sustainability in driving innovation and retaining and attracting talented employees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Vice President of Sustainability for Interface, Erin gives voice to the company&rsquo;s conscience, ensuring that strategy and goals are in sync with the aggressive sustainability vision established almost 20 years ago. She leads a team that provides technical assistance and support to the company&rsquo;s global business, addressing sustainability at all levels&ndash; from operations and management, to employees and customers, and in policy forums. And she also keeps a finger on the pulse of the company&rsquo;s transformed culture, a by product of sustainability thinking that has been critical in driving innovation and retaining and attracting talented employees. Erin and her team are focused on nourishing and reinforcing the unique culture, and also on documenting its evolution. Erin is a frequent lecturer on sustainable business to senior management teams, universities and the growing green consumer sector. She has spoken at a variety of conferences and forums including: Bioneers, Greenbuild, SXSW, Businesses for Social Responsibility and others. Erin is a magna cum laude graduate of the Vermont Law School, where she earned her Masters Degree in Studies in Environmental Law and her Juris Doctor degree.</p>
