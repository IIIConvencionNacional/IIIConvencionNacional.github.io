<p>He is an ambassador of One Young World, a non-profit organisation that provides young people with a global platform through which to effect positive change. He is currently leading the development of a youth engagement structure for South Africa&rsquo;s largest business advocacy and business representation body. The purpose of the youth structure is to provide input into the social policy positions of South African business. After being voted on by professional and trade bodies, these positions are then negotiated with government and labour in the National Economic Development and Labour Council. He sees this as an important platform for young professionals and young entrepreneurs to play an active role in driving more sustainable and responsible business.</p>
<p>He has represented the youth of South Africa on global platforms such as the Youth G20 Summit and currently heads up the Young Professionals Action Network in Johannesburg, South Africa.&nbsp;</p><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="speaker_socials"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/monde_nk" target="_blank">@monde_nk</a></div></div> </div>			<!-- /modal-body -->
