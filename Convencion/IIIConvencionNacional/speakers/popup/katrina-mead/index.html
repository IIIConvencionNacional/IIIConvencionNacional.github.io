<p>She has been instrumental in designing and implementing global projects and policies that need to be understood and motivate people at all levels of an organisation.&nbsp; These have successfully aligned behaviours to business objectives, transcended cultural divides and met different regulatory regimes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Katrina recently began working as an advisor to the UKBCSD on strategies to improve the use of ecosystem-related tools in UK businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Applying some of the principles for successfully implementing human capital strategies to environmental tools, this has focussed on encouraging whole-scale behavioural changes to embed these into business operations.&nbsp;&nbsp; She is working with the WBCSD to identify opportunities to broaden the reach to the international business community.</p>
<p>She holds a BSc in biological sciences (Sheffield University) and MSc in ecological economics (Edinburgh University) as well as professional tax qualifications, which include accountancy and law qualifications.</p><div class="clearfix"></div><div class="speaker_socials"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/UK_BCSD" target="_blank">@UK_BCSD</a></div></div> </div>			<!-- /modal-body -->
