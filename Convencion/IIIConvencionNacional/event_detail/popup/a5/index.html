Hear from two case studies about their approach.</h5>

<p>There are many risks of failing to understand natural capital impacts and dependencies. Those businesses which account for and seek to manage natural capital <span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">proactively<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></span>can reduce risk exposure. The reduction of environmental risk can build business resilience in the long-term but also create new opportunities for growth.</p>

<p>Sky Rainforest Rescue, a seven year partnership between Sky and WWF, has helped save one billion trees in the Acre in the Amazon. Hear from Sky and WWF as they highlight the importance of strong partnerships, new ways of reaching wide audiences, and creating on-the-ground impact by recognising the importance and value of natural capital and ecosystem services. They will also discuss the benefits of tackling deforestation for business and NGO&rsquo;s alike.</p>

<p>Hear from John Lewis and&nbsp;Eftec, on innovation in the pork supply chain to Waitrose, driven by water pollution risk, which resulted in the &lsquo;Eco Pig&rsquo; system. This system involves integrated management and enhancement of human, social and financial as well as natural capital.&nbsp;</p>
